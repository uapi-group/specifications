Operating systems cooperatively manage boot loader menu entry directories that contain drop-in files, making multi-boot scenarios easy to support. Boot menu entries are defined via two simple formats that can be understood by different boot loader implementations, operating systems, and userspace programs.</description></item><item><title>UAPI.1 Boot Loader Specification</title><link>https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/boot_loader_specification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/boot_loader_specification/</guid><description>UAPI.1 The Boot Loader Specification # Version Changes 1.0 Initial Release This document defines a set of file formats and naming conventions that allow the boot loader menu entries to be shared between multiple operating systems and boot loaders installed on one device.

# Linux File System Hierarchy

## Description

This page describes the layout of a modern Linux system.
This hierarchy is an evolution of the historical UNIX layout,
and includes concepts described in the
[File System Hierarchy](http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs-3.0.html)
specification and
[`hier(7)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/hier.7.html) man page,
and various extensions documented in the
[XDG Base Directory Specification](https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)
and [XDG User Directories](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xdg-user-dirs).

In some areas this document is stricter than those older documents.
In particular it makes additional restrictions and recommendations
to separate vendor defaults and local configuration, and also
static installed files, persistent data, and empheral runtime files.
In other areas it is simpler,
with the vendor files using a single hierarchy under `/usr`.

This document doesn't define the directory structure comprehensively,
it only documents a skeleton of a directory tree,
to be extended by additional directories lower in the hierarchy.
Some directories like `/var/spool/` are not covered,
even though it might make sense to include them
in the structure of an actually deployed OS.

Some directories are described for compatibility with current Linux distributions,
but their use is not recommended.
The subsections that describe those directories are marked with ⚠️.

Many of the paths described here can be queried with the
[`systemd-path(1)`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-path.html)
tool, on systems where this tool is available.

## General Structure

### `/`

The file system root.
Usually writable, but this is not required.
Possibly a temporary file system (`tmpfs`).
Not shared with other hosts (unless read-only).

### `/boot/`

The partition where kernels and other assets used to bring up the system are stored.
On EFI systems, this is possibly the EFI System Partition (ESP),
also see
[`systemd-gpt-auto-generator(8)`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-gpt-auto-generator.html).
This directory is usually strictly local to the host,
and should be considered read-only,
except when a kernel or boot loader is installed or updated.
This directory is only populated on systems that run on
physical or emulated hardware that requires a boot loader.

### `/efi/`

If the EFI System Partition (ESP) is maintained separately
from the boot partition described in the previous section,
it is mounted here.
Tools that need to operate on the ESP should look for it at this mount point first,
and fall back to `/boot/` — if the first location does not qualify
(for example if it is not a mount point
or does not have the correct file system type `MSDOS_SUPER_MAGIC`).

### `/etc/`

System-specific configuration.
This directory may be read-only.
Frequently, this directory is pre-populated with vendor-supplied configuration files,
but applications should not make assumptions
about this directory being fully populated or populated at all,
and should fall back to defaults if configuration is missing,
following the
[Configuration Files Specification](configuration_files_specification.md).

If `/opt/` is supported (see below),
then the `/etc/opt/` ⚠️ subdirectory is the location where
third-party software installed in `/opt/` may store its configuration.
The same naming convention as directories under `/opt/` is used for directories under `/etc/opt/`.

### `/home/`

The location for normal user's home directories.
Possibly shared with other systems, and never read-only.
This directory should only be used for normal users, never for system users.
This directory and possibly the directories contained within it
might only become available or writable in late boot or even only after user authentication.
This directory might be placed on limited-functionality network file systems,
hence applications should not assume the full set of file API is available on this directory.
Applications should generally not reference this directory directly,
but via the per-user `$HOME` environment variable,
or via the home directory field of the user database.

### `/opt/` ⚠️

A secondary location for third-party vendor directories.
This directory is optional,
as not all systems allow installing third-party software.

Each third-party vendor (i.e.: unrelated to the OS provider) may use a subdirectory,
typically named after the vendor or the software, under this location.
It is usually read-only, but this is not required.
This directory should not be modified by the administrator,
except when installing or removing third-party-supplied software.

Using `/opt/` is not recommended.
It is not integrated with the rest of the distribution:
a package which uses `/opt/` may need to install
binaries or links in `/usr/bin/`
and other supplementary files,
e.g. desktops files or manual pages,
into their appropriate locations under `/usr`.
Instead of using a subdirectory under `/opt/`,
a third party vendor should put their directory under `/usr/lib/`.

### `/root/`

The home directory of the root user.
The root user's home directory is located outside of `/home/`
in order to make sure the root user may log in
even without `/home/` being available and mounted.

### `/srv/`

The place to store general server payload, managed by the administrator.
No restrictions are made how this directory is organized internally.
Generally writable, and possibly shared among systems.
This directory might become available or writable only very late during boot.

### `/tmp/`

The place for small temporary files.
This directory is usually mounted as a `tmpfs` instance,
and should hence not be used for larger files.
(Use `/var/tmp/` for larger files.)
This directory is usually flushed at boot-up.
Also, files that are not accessed within a certain time may be automatically deleted.

If applications find the environment variable `$TMPDIR` set,
they should use the directory specified in it instead of `/tmp/`
(see
[`environ(7)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/environ.7.html) and
[IEEE Std 1003.1](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html#tag_08_03)
for details).

Since `/tmp/` is accessible to other users of the system,
it is essential that files and subdirectories under this directory are only created with
[`mkstemp(3)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mkstemp.3.html),
[`mkdtemp(3)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mkdtemp.3.html),
and similar calls.
For more details, see
[Using /tmp/ and /var/tmp/ Safely](https://systemd.io/TEMPORARY_DIRECTORIES).

## Runtime Data

### `/run/`

A `tmpfs` file system for system packages to place
runtime data, socket files, and similar.
This directory is flushed on boot,
and generally writable for privileged programs only.
Always writable.

### `/run/log/`

Runtime system logs.
System components may place private logs in this directory.
Always writable, even when `/var/log/` might not be accessible yet.

### `/run/user/`

Contains per-user runtime directories,
each usually individually mounted `tmpfs` instances.
Always writable, flushed at each reboot and when the user logs out.
User code should not reference this directory directly,
but via the `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` environment variable,
as documented in the
[XDG Base Directory Specification](https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html).

## Vendor-supplied Operating System Resources

### `/usr/`

Vendor-supplied operating system resources.
Usually read-only, but this is not required.
Possibly shared between multiple hosts.
This directory should not be modified by the administrator,
except when installing or removing vendor-supplied packages.

### `/usr/bin/`

Binaries and executables for user commands that shall appear in the `$PATH` search path.
It is recommended not to place binaries in this directory
that are not useful for invocation from a shell (such as daemon binaries);
these should be placed in a subdirectory of `/usr/lib/` instead.

### `/usr/include/`

Programmatic APIs header files, typically used when compiling `C/C++` programs.
Packages may place such files either directly in `/usr/include/`,
or in a subdirectory.
Using a subdirectory is recommended if the package installs multiple files.
It is also necessary if multiple versions of the same headers shall be coinstallable.
The subdirectory may be named after the package or project providing it.
Packages may place architecture-dependent header files and directories in a
`/usr/include/arch-id/` subdirectory,
following the identifiers defined on the
[Multiarch Architecture Specifiers (Tuples)](https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/Tuples)
list.

Note that to use the headers, flags for the compiler may be required
to bring the appropriate subdirectory into the search path.
See man pages
[`pc(7)`](https://www.mankier.com/5/pc),
[`pkgconf(1)`](https://www.mankier.com/1/pkgconf),
[gcc's Search Path](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Search-Path.html),
and other compiler-specific documentation.

The corresponding library or libraries shall be placed in `$libdir`, see below.

### `/usr/lib/`

Static, private vendor data that is compatible with all architectures
(though not necessarily architecture-independent).
Note that this includes
internal binaries or other programs that are not regularly invoked from a shell.
Such binaries may be for any architecture supported by the system.
Do not place public libraries in this directory,
use `$libdir` (see below), instead.

### `/usr/libexec/` ⚠️

A secondary location for
vendor binaries or other programs that are not regularly invoked from a shell
that is used by some distributions.
Packages may either place such programs
in a subdirectory of `/usr/lib/`,
directly in `/usr/libexec/`,
or in a subdirectory of `/usr/libexec/` named after the package.
The first option is the recommended approach.
`/usr/libexec/` is used by some distributions,
so it is mentioned here too,
but its use is not encouraged.

Binaries in `/usr/libexec/` may be for any architecture supported by the system.

### `/usr/lib/arch-id/`

Location for placing dynamic libraries into, also called `$libdir`.
The architecture identifier to use is defined on the
[Multiarch Architecture Specifiers (Tuples)](https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/Tuples)
list.
Legacy locations of `$libdir` are `/usr/lib/`, `/usr/lib64/`.

This directory should not be used for package-specific data,
unless this data is architecture-dependent, too.

The primary architecture of the system (`$libdir`) may be queried with:

    systemd-path system-library-arch

### `/usr/share/`

Resources shared between multiple packages,
such as documentation, man pages, time zone information, fonts and other resources.
Usually, the precise location and format of files stored below this directory
is subject to specifications that ensure interoperability.

Note that resources placed in this directory may be under shared ownership,
with multiple different packages providing and consuming these resources
on equal footing without any obvious primary owner.

### `/usr/share/doc/`

Documentation for the operating system or system packages.

### `/usr/share/factory/etc/`

Repository for vendor-supplied default configuration files.
This directory should be populated with pristine vendor versions
of all configuration files that may be placed in `/etc/`.
This is useful to compare the local configuration of a system with vendor defaults
and to populate the local configuration with defaults.

Software should not read configuration settings directly from `/usr/share/factory/`.
Those files will be copied to other locations if appropriate,
and should only be read from there.

### `/usr/share/factory/var/`

Similar to `/usr/share/factory/etc/`,
but for vendor versions of files in the variable, persistent data directory `/var/`.
The same recommendations as for `/usr/share/factory/etc/` apply here.

## Persistent Variable System Data

### `/var/`

Persistent, variable system data.
Writable during normal system operation.
This directory might be pre-populated with vendor-supplied data,
but applications should be able to reconstruct
necessary files and directories in this subhierarchy should they be missing,
as the system might start up without this directory being populated.
Persistency is recommended, but optional, to support ephemeral systems.
This directory might become available or writable only very late during boot.
Components that are required to operate during early boot
hence shall not unconditionally rely on this directory.

### `/var/cache/`

Persistent system cache data.
System components may place non-essential data in this directory.
Flushing this directory should have no effect on operation of programs,
except for increased runtimes necessary to rebuild these caches.

### `/var/lib/`

Persistent system data.
System components may place private data in this directory.

### `/var/log/`

Persistent system logs.
System components may place private logs in this directory,
though it is recommended to do most logging via the
[`syslog(3)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/syslog.3.html) and
[`sd_journal_print(3)`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd_journal_print.html)
calls.

### `/var/opt/` ⚠️

If `/opt/` is supported (see above),
then the `/var/opt/` subdirectory is the location where third-party software installed in `/opt/`
stores its persistent, variable data.
The same naming convention as directories under `/opt/` is used for directories under `/var/opt/`.

### `/var/tmp/`

The place for larger and persistent temporary files.
In contrast to `/tmp/`,
this directory is usually mounted from a persistent physical file system
and can thus accept larger files.
(Use `/tmp/` for small ephemeral files.)
This directory is generally not flushed at boot-up,
but time-based cleanup of files that have not been accessed for a certain time is applied.

If applications find the environment variable `$TMPDIR` set,
they should use the directory specified in it instead of `/var/tmp/`
(see [`environ(7)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/environ.7.html)
for details).

The same security restrictions as with `/tmp/` apply:
[`mkstemp(3)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mkstemp.3.html),
[`mkdtemp(3)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mkdtemp.3.html),
and similar calls should be used.
For further details about this directory, see
[Using /tmp/ and /var/tmp/ Safely](https://systemd.io/TEMPORARY_DIRECTORIES).

## Virtual Kernel and API File Systems

### `/dev/`

The root directory for device nodes.
Usually, this directory is mounted as a `devtmpfs` instance,
but might be of a different type in sandboxed/containerized setups.
This directory is managed jointly by the kernel and
a userspace component such as
[`systemd-udevd(8)`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-udevd.html),
and should not be written to by other components.
A number of special purpose virtual file systems might be mounted below this directory.

### `/dev/shm/`

Place for POSIX shared memory segments, as created via
[`shm_open(3)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/shm_open.3.html).
This directory is flushed on boot,
and is a `tmpfs` file system.
Since all users have write access to this directory,
special care should be taken to avoid name clashes and vulnerabilities.
For normal users, shared memory segments in this directory are usually deleted
when the user logs out.
Usually, it is a better idea to use memory mapped files in `/run/` (for system programs)
or `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (for user programs)
instead of POSIX shared memory segments,
since these directories are not world-writable
and hence not vulnerable to security-sensitive name clashes.

### `/proc/`

A virtual kernel file system exposing the process list and other functionality.
This file system is mostly an API to interface with the kernel
and not a place where normal files may be stored.
For details, see
[`proc(5)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html).
A number of special purpose virtual file systems might be mounted below this directory.

### `/proc/sys/`

A hierarchy below `/proc/` that exposes a number of kernel tunables.
The primary way to configure the settings in this API file tree is via
[`sysctl.d(5)`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sysctl.d.html)
files.
In sandboxed/containerized setups, this directory is generally mounted read-only.

### `/sys/`

A virtual kernel file system exposing discovered devices and other functionality.
This file system is mostly an API to interface with the kernel
and not a place where normal files may be stored.
In sandboxed/containerized setups, this directory is generally mounted read-only.
A number of special purpose virtual file systems might be mounted below this directory.

### `/sys/fs/cgroup/`

A virtual kernel file system exposing process control groups (cgroups).
This file system is an API to interface with the kernel
and not a place where normal files may be stored.
On current systems running in the default "unified" mode,
this directory serves as the mount point for the `cgroup2` filesystem,
which provides a unified cgroup hierarchy for all resource controllers.
On systems with non-default configurations,
this directory may instead be a tmpfs filesystem
containing mount points for various `cgroup` (v1) resource controllers;
in such configurations,
if `cgroup2` is mounted it will be mounted on `/sys/fs/cgroup/unified/`,
but cgroup2 will not have resource controllers attached.
In sandboxed/containerized setups,
this directory may either not exist or may include a subset of functionality.

## Compatibility Symlinks

### `/bin/`; `/sbin/`; `/usr/sbin/`

These compatibility symlinks point to `/usr/bin/`,
ensuring that scripts and binaries referencing these legacy paths
correctly find their binaries.

### `/lib/`

This compatibility symlink points to `/usr/lib/`,
ensuring that programs referencing this legacy path
correctly find their resources.

### `/lib64/`

On some architecture ABIs, this compatibility symlink points to `$libdir`,
ensuring that binaries referencing this legacy path
correctly find their dynamic loader.
This symlink only exists on architectures whose ABI
places the dynamic loader in this path.

### `/var/run/`

This compatibility symlink points to `/run/`,
ensuring that programs referencing this legacy path
correctly find their runtime data.

## Home Directory

User applications may want to place files and directories
in the user's home directory.
They should follow the following basic structure.
Note that some of these directories are also standardized
(though more weakly) by the
[XDG Base Directory Specification](https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html).
Additional locations for high-level user resources are defined by
[xdg-user-dirs](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xdg-user-dirs).

### `~/.cache/`

Persistent user cache data.
User programs may place non-essential data in this directory.
Flushing this directory should have no effect on operation of programs,
except for increased runtimes necessary to rebuild these caches.
If an application finds `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` set,
it should use the directory specified in it instead of this directory.

### `~/.config/`

Application configuration.
When a new user is created, this directory will be empty or not exist at all.
Applications should fall back to defaults
should their configuration in this directory be missing.
If an application finds `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` set,
it should use the directory specified in it instead of this directory.

### `~/.local/bin/`

Executables that shall appear in the user's `$PATH` search path.
It is recommended not to place executables in this directory
that are not useful for invocation from a shell;
these should be placed in a subdirectory of `~/.local/lib/` instead.
Care should be taken when placing architecture-dependent binaries in this place,
which might be problematic if the home directory is shared
between multiple hosts with different architectures.

### `~/.local/lib/`

Static, private vendor data that is compatible with all architectures.

### `~/.local/lib/arch-id/`

Location for placing public dynamic libraries.
The architecture identifier to use is defined on
[Multiarch Architecture Specifiers (Tuples)](https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/Tuples)
list.

### `~/.local/share/`

Resources shared between multiple packages, such as fonts or artwork.
Usually, the precise location and format of files stored below this directory
is subject to specifications that ensure interoperability.
If an application finds `$XDG_DATA_HOME` set,
it should use the directory specified in it instead of this directory.

### `~/.local/state/`

Application state.
When a new user is created, this directory will be empty or not exist at all.
Applications should fall back to defaults
should their state in this directory be missing.
If an application finds `$XDG_STATE_HOME` set,
it should use the directory specified in it instead of this directory.

## Write Access

### Unprivileged Write Access

Unprivileged processes generally lack write access to most of the hierarchy.

The exceptions for normal users are `/tmp/`, `/var/tmp/`, `/dev/shm/`,
as well as the home directory `$HOME` (usually found below `/home/`)
and the runtime directory `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (found below `/run/user/`)
of the user, which are all writable.

For unprivileged system processes,
only `/tmp/`, `/var/tmp/`, and `/dev/shm/` are writable.
If an unprivileged system process needs a private writable directory
in `/var/` or `/run/`,
it is recommended to to create it via
the `StateDirectory=` and `RuntimeDirectory=` directives of service units
(see
[`systemd.unit(5)`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html)
for details),
or via
[`tmpfiles.d(5)`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/tmpfiles.d.html)
fragments during boot.
A daemon may also create it before dropping privileges,
but it is not recommended to start the daemon with privileges just for this.

`/tmp/`, `/var/tmp/`, and `/dev/shm/` should be mounted `nosuid` and `nodev`,
which means that set-user-id mode and character or block special devices
are not interpreted on those file systems.
In general it is not possible to mount them `noexec`,
because various programs use those directories
for dynamically generated or optimized code,
and with that flag those use cases would break.
Using this flag is OK on special-purpose installations or systems where
all software that may be installed is known and does not require such functionality.
See the discussion of `nosuid`/`nodev`/`noexec` in
[`mount(8)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html)
and `PROT_EXEC` in
[`mmap(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html).

### Lack of Write Access on Read-Only Systems and during System Recovery

As noted above, some systems operate with
the `/usr` and `/etc` hierarchies mounted read-only,
possibly only allowing write access during package upgrades.
Other part of the hierarchy are generally mounted read-write
(in particular `/var` and `/var/tmp`),
but may be read-only when the kernel remounts the file system read-only
in response to errors,
or when the system is booted read-only for recovery purposes.
To the extent reasonable,
applications should be prepared to execute without write access,
so that for example, failure to save non-essential data to `/var/cache/`
or failure to create a custom log file under `/var/log`
does not prevent the application from running.

The `/run/` directory is available since the earliest boot
and is always writable.
It should be used for any runtime data and sockets,
so that write access to e.g. `/etc` or `/var` is not needed.

## Node Types

Unix file systems support different types of file nodes,
including regular files, directories, symlinks, character and block device nodes,
sockets and FIFOs.

It is strongly recommended that `/dev/` is
the only location below which device nodes shall be placed.
Similarly, `/run/` shall be the only location to place sockets and FIFOs.
Regular files, directories and symlinks may be used in all directories.

Applications should expect that a security policy
might be enforced on a system that enforces these rules.

## System Packages

Developers of system packages should follow strict rules
when placing their files in the file system.
The following table lists recommended locations for
specific types of files supplied by the vendor.

### System package vendor files locations

| Directory                   | Purpose |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| `/usr/bin/`                 | Package executables that shall appear in the `$PATH` executable search path, compiled for any of the supported architectures compatible with the operating system. It is not recommended to place internal binaries or binaries that are not commonly invoked from the shell in this directory, such as daemon binaries. As this directory is shared with most other packages of the system, special care should be taken to pick unique names for files placed here, that are unlikely to clash with other package's files. |
| `/usr/lib/arch-id/`         | Public shared libraries of the package. As above, be careful with using too generic names, and pick unique names for your libraries to place here to avoid name clashes. |
| `/usr/lib/package/`         | Private static vendor resources of the package, including private binaries and libraries, or any other kind of read-only vendor data. |
| `/usr/lib/arch-id/package/` | Private other vendor resources of the package that are architecture-specific and cannot be shared between architectures. Note that this generally does not include private executables since binaries of a specific architecture may be freely invoked from any other supported system architecture. |

Additional static vendor files with shared ownership
may be installed in the `/usr/share/` hierarchy
to the locations defined by the various relevant specifications.

### System package variable files locations

The following directories shall be used by the package for
local configuration and files created during runtime:

| Directory                       | Purpose |
|---------------------------------|---------|
| `/etc/package/`       | System-specific configuration for the package. It is recommended to default to safe fallbacks if this configuration is missing, if this is possible. Alternatively, a[`tmpfiles.d(5)`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/tmpfiles.d.html) fragment may be used to copy or symlink the necessary files and directories from `/usr/share/factory/` during boot, via the `L` or `C` directives. |
| `/run/package/`       | Runtime data for the package. Packages must be able to create the necessary subdirectories in this tree on their own, since the directory is flushed automatically on boot. Alternatively, a [`tmpfiles.d(5)`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/tmpfiles.d.html) fragment may be used to create the necessary directories during boot, or the `RuntimeDirectory=` directive of service units may be used to create them at service startup (see [`systemd.unit(5)`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html) for details).                                    |
| `/run/log/package/`   | Runtime log data for the package. As above, the package needs to make sure to create this directory if necessary, as it will be flushed on every boot. |
| `/var/cache/package/` | Persistent cache data of the package. If this directory is flushed, the application should work correctly on next invocation, though possibly slowed down due to the need to rebuild any local cache files. The application must be capable of recreating this directory should it be missing and necessary. To create an empty directory, a [`tmpfiles.d(5)`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/tmpfiles.d.html) fragment or the `CacheDirectory=` directive of service units (see [`systemd.unit(5)`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html)) may be used. |
| `/var/lib/package/`   | Persistent private data of the package. This is the primary place to put persistent data that does not fall into the other categories listed. Packages should be able to create the necessary subdirectories in this tree on their own, since the directory might be missing on boot. To create an empty directory, a [`tmpfiles.d(5)`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/tmpfiles.d.html) fragment or the `StateDirectory=` directive of service units (see [`systemd.unit(5)`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html)) may be used. |
| `/var/log/package/`   | Persistent log data of the package. As above, the package should make sure to create this directory if necessary, possibly using [`tmpfiles.d(5)`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/tmpfiles.d.html) or `LogsDirectory=` (see [`systemd.exec(5)`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html)), as it might be missing.

## User Packages

Programs running in user context should follow strict rules
when placing their own files in the user's home directory.
The following table lists recommended locations
in the home directory for specific types of files supplied by the vendor
if the application is installed in the home directory.
(User applications installed system-wide are
covered by the rules outlined above for vendor files.)

### Vendor package file locations under the home directory of the user

| Directory                       | Purpose |
|---------------------------------|---------|
| `~/.local/bin/`                 | Package executables that shall appear in the `$PATH` executable search path. It is not recommended to place internal executables or executables that are not commonly invoked from the shell in this directory, such as daemon executables. As this directory is shared with most other packages of the user, special care should be taken to pick unique names for files placed here, that are unlikely to clash with other package's files. |
| `~/.local/lib/arch-id/`         | Public shared libraries of the package. As above, be careful with using overly generic names, and pick unique names for your libraries to place here to avoid name clashes. |
| `~/.local/lib/package/`         | Private, static vendor resources of the package, compatible with any architecture, or any other kind of read-only vendor data. |
| `~/.local/lib/arch-id/package/` | Private other vendor resources of the package that are architecture-specific and cannot be shared between architectures. |

Additional static vendor files with shared ownership
may be installed in the `~/.local/share/` hierarchy,
mirroring the subdirectories specified in the section
"Vendor-supplied operating system resources" above.

### User package variable file locations

The following directories shall be used by the package for
per-user local configuration and files created during runtime:

| Directory                   | Purpose |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| `~/.config/package/`        | User-specific configuration for the package. It is required to default to safe fallbacks if this configuration is missing. |
| `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/package/` | User runtime data for the package. |
| `~/.cache/package/`         | Persistent cache data of the package. If this directory is flushed, the application should work correctly on next invocation, though possibly slowed down due to the need to rebuild any local cache files. The application must be capable of recreating this directory should it be missing and necessary. |
| `~/.local/state/package/`   | Persistent state data of the package. |
